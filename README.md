The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic paper-and-pencil or board game played between two players. The goal is to be the first to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid. Here's how it works:

    Setup: Start with an empty 3x3 grid or game board.

    Player's Turns: Players take turns placing their symbols on the board. The first player uses "X," and the second player uses "O."

    Placing Symbols: Each turn, a player selects an empty cell on the grid to place their symbol. The first player starts by placing their symbol in any cell they choose.

    Win Conditions: The game continues until one of the players gets three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When this happens, that player wins the game. If all nine cells on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
