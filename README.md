Here is an Algorithm that details the step by step process:

    1 Initialize the game board:
        Create a 3x3 matrix to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
        Use 'X', 'O', and an empty space ' ' to represent player moves.

    2Display the initial board:
        Print the current state of the board to show the available cells.

    3 Start the game loop:
        Alternate between players (X and O) until the game is won or ends in a draw.

    4. Get player input:
        For the current player, ask for their move (row and column) on the board.

    5. Validate the move:
        Check if the move is valid (within the boundaries and the cell is not already taken).

    6. Update the board:
        Place the player's symbol on the chosen cell.

    7. Check for a win or draw:
        After each move, check if the current player has won the game (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) or if the board is full (draw).

    End the game:
        Display the final board state.
        Declare the winner or announce a draw.

    Ask for a rematch or exit the game loop.


The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic paper-and-pencil or board game played between two players. The goal is to be the first to form a line of three of your symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid. Here's how it works:

    Setup: Start with an empty 3x3 grid or game board.

    Player's Turns: Players take turns placing their symbols on the board. The first player uses "X," and the second player uses "O."

    Placing Symbols: Each turn, a player selects an empty cell on the grid to place their symbol. The first player starts by placing their symbol in any cell they choose.

    Win Conditions: The game continues until one of the players gets three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When this happens, that player wins the game. If all nine cells on the grid are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
